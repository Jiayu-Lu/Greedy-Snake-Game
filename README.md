## TypeScript

TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language developed and maintained by the Microsoft Corporation. It is a superset of JavaScript and contains all of its elements.

**TypeScript totally follows the OOPS concept** and with the help of TSC (TypeScript Compiler), we can convert Typescript code (.ts file) to JavaScript (.js file)



## Why Use TypeScript?

- TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug.
- TypeScript is open source.
- TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking.
- TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand.
- With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript.
- TypeScript gives us all the benefits of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), plus more productivity.
- TypeScript can help us to avoid painful bugs that developers commonly run into when writing JavaScript by type checking the code.
- Powerful type system, including generics.
- TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript with some additional features.
- Structural, rather than nominal.
- TypeScript code can be compiled as per ES5 and ES6 standards to support the latest browser.
- Aligned with ECMAScript for compatibility.
- Starts and ends with JavaScript.
- Supports static typing.
- TypeScript will save developers time.
- TypeScript is a superset of ES3, ES5, and ES6.

### Additional Features of TypeScript

- Functions with optional parameters.
- Functions with REST parameters.
- Generics support.
- Modules support.
